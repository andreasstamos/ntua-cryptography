# Computational Cryptography - 9th Semester - ECE NTUA

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and also the project I conducted, for the *Computational Cryptography* course at
[ECE NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), offered during the 2024‚Äì2025 academic year.

## üîê Project

The project is about **Publicly Verifiable & Delegatable Computing** and also contains an **Introduction to the Pairing-Based Cryptography**.

It is primarily based on the paper:

Kaoutar Elkhiyaoui *et al.*,\
**Efficient Techniques for Publicly Verifiable Delegation of Computation**\
*Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIA CCS '16)*\
ACM, May 2016. [DOI: 10.1145/2897845.2897910](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2897845.2897910)

The introduction to pairing-based cryptography is based on the paper:

Alfred Menezes,\
**An Introduction to Pairing-Based Cryptography**\
2009. [DOI: 10.1090/conm/477/09303](http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/conm/477/09303)

Besides the schemes of this project, some interesting applications of Pairing-Based Cryptography, which are described with more details in the report, include:
- The Joux Protocol for One-Round Three-Party Key Exchange,
- The Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Signatures (BLS), known for being short (for the same equivalent bits of security).
- The Boneh-Franklin Identity-Based Encryption Scheme.

The main part of the project is about:
- A Publicly Verifiable & Delegatable Computing Scheme for **Evalution of Polynomials**.
- A Publicly Verifiable & Delegatable Computing Scheme for **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**.

**üí° Noteworthy Contribution**

For the second scheme, I have introduced an **enhancement** that **reduces the computational complexity** of certain operations and ‚Äîmore importantly‚Äî also
**lowers the order of magnitude of the size of certain transmitted data**.
